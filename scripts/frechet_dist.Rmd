                   } else { }
           })
```

```{r graph_setup, echo=FALSE}
g_labels <- c("trajectories", "fixed-time mean",
            "fixed-time median", "Fréchet mean")
g_cols <- c("gray","blue","purple","red")
```

This is inspired by @juul2021. 

In the paper, pitfalls of fixed-time mean trajectory (the pointwise mean at each time step) are explored and an alternative curve-based method, which is based on ranking the curves and sampling, is studied.

Juul *et al* suggest three different ways to rank the centrality of curves;

- all-or-nothing ranking method (Fig.2b,c)
- weighted ranking (Fig.2d)
- according to some feature of interest (Fig.2e), e.g. the projected peak value

The first two approaches, which involve subsampling, seem odd to me (BMB). Is the sampling-based approach done to minimize computational cost? The approach suggested below is computationally expensive, since it requires computing *all* pairwise distances between the curves in the ensemble (there may be a clever way to do this, although a quick lit search gives only metric-specific algorithms [e.g. on the space of phylogenetic trees or on the hypersphere], not general ideas).

Our approach is to use the Fréchet distance (see below) and quantiles of centrality.
  
- suppose we have a set of trajectories.
- Fréchet distance between the trajectories to be calculated,
- the distribution of the distances can be estimated, (**BMB**: what does this tell us?)
- the curve-based descriptive statistics can be [?] as follows 
  (1) ranking the curves from more central (closer to the distribution mean/median I propose) to less central
  (2) Plot the envelope containing the most central curves, i.e. the pointwise min/max curves of a subset of curves with the lowest sum (or sum of squares) of distances to the other curves.

## Fréchet distances

The [Fréchet distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_distance) is a distance metric for curves.

```{r packages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(SimilarityMeasures) ## for Fréchet distance computation
```

<!-- BMB: avoid chunk names containing spaces etc. -->

```{r simple_examples, echo= FALSE, results="hide"}
# Creating two trajectories.
path1 <- matrix(c(0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3), 4)
path2 <- matrix(c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), 4)
# Running the Fréchet distance algorithm.
Frechet(path1, path2)
```

```{r simple2}
n_sample <- 10 ## num of data points, days
n_traj <- 20 ## number of trajectories
t <- 1:n_sample
set.seed(1234)
M <- replicate(n_traj,rnorm(n_sample,mean = n_sample/2))
```

```{r fixedtime1, fig.cap="Fixed-time mean/median; the pointwise mean at each time step",basefig=TRUE}
{matplot(x=t,y=M,type = "l", lty=1, col = g_cols[1], ylab="")
lines(t,rowMeans(M), col = g_cols[2], lwd = 2)
lines(t, apply(M,1,median),col=g_cols[3])
legend("topright", legend = g_labels[1:3] , col=g_cols[1:3],
       lty=1, bg="white")
}

```

Calculate all of the pairwise Fréchet distances between trajectories:

```{r frechet_dist}
dmat <- matrix(NA, n_traj, n_traj)
diag(dmat) <- 0
for (i in 1:(n_traj-1)) {
    for (j in (i+1):n_traj) {
        dmat[i,j] <- Frechet(matrix(M[,i]),matrix(M[,j]))
    }
}
## symmetrize (is there something built-in? Matrix::forceSymmetric
##  converts to a fancy Matrix object ...
dmat[lower.tri(dmat)] <- t(dmat)[lower.tri(dmat)]
stopifnot(isSymmetric(dmat))
```

# histogram of Fréchet dist
```{r fig.cap="density plot of Fréchet distances"}
hist(dmat[lower.tri(dmat)],xlab="Fréchet distance",main="",breaks=20)
```

Find the [Fréchet mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_mean) (min average distance = most central point), considering the ensemble of curves to be the entire set of possibilities

```{r frechet2}
## Fréchet mean corresponding to arith mean: minimize sum of squares of distances
md2 <- rowSums(dmat^2)  
fm2 <- which.min(md2)
## Fm corresponding to median: minimize sum of distances 
md1 <- rowSums(dmat)
fm1 <- which.min(md1)
```

In this case the Fréchet mean & median are the same;
but the rankings for (sum of distances to all other curves) and (sum of squared distances) are not quite identical, so regions will differ. We'll use the 'median-like' criterion (sum of distances).

```{r fcor}
cor.test(md1,md2,method="spearman")$estimate
fm <- fm1 ## we use median-like
```

Find the envelope of the most central 50% (is this right??)

```{r find_envelope}
central_curves <- which(md1<quantile(md1,0.5))
## POINTWISE min/max of these curves (?)
fmin <- apply(M[,central_curves],1,min)
fmax <- apply(M[,central_curves],1,max)
```

Compute pointwise central 50% quantiles for comparison:
```{r pointquant}
pqmin <- apply(M,1,quantile,0.25)
pqmax <- apply(M,1,quantile,0.75)
```

```{r plot_all,basefig=TRUE,fig.cap="fixed-time and Fréchet metrics: gray (wide)=50% central Fréchet region, green (narrow)=fixed-time central region"}
{matplot(x=t,y=M,type = "l", col = g_cols[1], lty=1,ylim=c(0,10))
lines(t,rowMeans(M), col = g_cols[2], lwd = 2)
lines(t,apply(M,1,median), col = g_cols[3], lwd = 2)
lines(t,M[,fm], col = g_cols[4], lwd = 2)
polygon(c(t,rev(t)),c(fmin,rev(fmax)), col=adjustcolor("black",alpha.f=0.05),
        border=NA)
polygon(c(t,rev(t)),c(pqmin,rev(pqmax)), col=adjustcolor("green",alpha.f=0.2),
        border=NA)
legend("topright", legend = g_labels,
       col= g_cols, lty=1, bg="white")       
}
```

The region here (which is supposed to represent the central 50% of the sample) seems a bit odd; it is much wider than the pointwise 50% range. Maybe that's as expected?

The Fréchet distance is a natural choice given that we are working with curves, but there's no reason that we have to use that distance metric: the Fréchet **mean** (and associated concepts of centrality) is (IMO) more important than the choice of distance metric. For example, we could use a Mahalanobis distance on the time points (although this doesn't include any information, e.g., about the time-ordering of the points, which seems weird?), or the Mahalanobis distance of a set of epidemiologically relevant metrics (e.g. {peak time, peak height, time to 5% of cumulative infection, epidemic duration}).

It would be interesting to apply this approach to @juul2021's examples. Or we could apply Juul *et al.*'s algorithms to this example.

- Does our approach have any advantages other than being (apparently) better posed?
- Does @juul2021's sampling-based approach have any theoretical justification? Does it correspond to some kind of approximation of central components as defined here? (The distance metric is certainly different ...)

More searching for prior art: does anyone in the functional data analysis world do anything like this already? Where would we look/who would we ask? ("Fréchet" is a nice distinctive search term, but so far I have found anything directly relevant ...)
